- Frequency domain concepts

**Unit 2 - Processing Techniques:**
- Spatial domain enhancement (histogram, filtering)
- Frequency domain enhancement (spectral filtering)
- Image segmentation (edges, regions, thresholding)
- Feature detection and extraction

**Unit 3 - Compression:**
- Information theory and redundancy
- Lossless compression (Huffman, LZW, RLE)
- Lossy compression (transform, predictive, wavelet)
- JPEG standard implementation

**Unit 4 - Video Fundamentals:**
- Video signal representation
- Motion models and image formation
- Temporal processing and filtering
- Video sampling and reconstruction

**Unit 5 - Motion & Video Coding:**
- Motion estimation algorithms
- Optical flow computation
